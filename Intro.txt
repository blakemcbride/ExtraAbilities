Right now, Extra Abilities provides the following facilities:

    Our list handling capability is a replacement for that already found
    in Alexa.  Our facility provides the following additional functionality:
    
	* much smarter interface with lots of help - easier to use
	
	* ability to email your list to yourself (possibly for printing)
	
	* ability to re-order your list
	
	* ability to rename your list
	
	* ability to change an item on your list
	
	* ability to add new items at the beginning or end of the list
